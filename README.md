# MisteryTheGame
A 2D Platformer game i made using only native Java.
For that I have watched following Tutorial

And expanded upon it by adding Enemies with "AI" and Player attacks for instance.

## Requirements
* Java SDK > 1.5

## How to build
Using eclipse, just export to jar file using "file>export"

## How to play
Run the executable file and use the mouse to click on either the play or exit button (settings button doesn't do anything)
Play using wasd inputs for left, right movement and jumping. Use f for attacks.
